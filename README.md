# Lab 1: Introduction to PyTorch

ðŸ“˜ MIT Introduction to Deep Learning - 2025

Welcome to **Lab 1** of the [MIT Introduction to Deep Learning](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) course. This lab introduces the basics of **PyTorch**, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. It includes hands-on experience with tensors, neural networks, and automatic differentiation, setting the foundation for future deep learning labs and projects.

## ðŸ§  What You Will Learn

* Fundamentals of **PyTorch** tensors and operations
* Defining and manipulating tensors of different shapes and ranks
* Creating computation graphs and custom operations
* Building and testing **neural networks** using:

  * Manual layer implementation
  * `nn.Sequential`
  * Subclassing `nn.Module`
* Understanding and using **automatic differentiation** with `autograd`
* Implementing **gradient descent** from scratch

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [mitdeeplearning](https://pypi.org/project/mitdeeplearning/) Python package

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Run on Google Colab

You can open and run this notebook in Google Colab using the link below:
ðŸ‘‰ [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MITDeepLearning/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab1/PT_Part1_Intro.ipynb)

### Local Setup (Optional)

If you prefer to run it locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MITDeepLearning/introtodeeplearning.git
   cd introtodeeplearning/lab1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
